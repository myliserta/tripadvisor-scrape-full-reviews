This R script, allows you to scrape full reviews from the Trip Advisor website.
Please check if you have the right/licenses to scrape data from Trip Advisor in your country/region.
The script uses basically R and Rselenium.
Download Rselenium as a standalone server and put it in your R working directory.
Get a csv file containing a list with the URL links of all the hotels you want to scrape. The column has to have the heading "link".

The script is "as it is", I assume no responsibility on how you use it.
