This R script, allows you to scrape full reviews from the Trip Advisor website.
It was tested on Ubuntu 64 bit, on other platforms the script should work too.
Please check if you have the right/licenses to scrape data from Trip Advisor in your country/region.
The script uses basically R, phantomjs and selenium.
Download selenium as a standalone server http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/ and put it in your R working directory.
Download phantomjs http://phantomjs.org/download.html and put it in your R working directory.
Get a csv file containing a list with the URL links of all the hotels you want to scrape. The column has to have the heading "link".

The script is "as it is", I assume no responsibility on how you use it.
